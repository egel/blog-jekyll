Welcome! My name is Maciej Sypie≈Ñ and I'm a software engineer from Poland with a great passion for web development.
During work, I'm always trying to do my best, furthermore with enthusiasm and open mind search for or listen to other creative conceptions.

I'm also involved in few Open Source projects and among them are:
