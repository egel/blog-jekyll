Hi! My name is Maciej SypieÅ„ and I'm a software engineer from Poland with a great passion for web development (especially for the frontend, backend, UX/UI design, and mobile applications).
During work, I'm always trying to do my best. Furthermore with enthusiasm and open mind, I search for or listen to other creative concepts.

I'm also involved in a few Open Source projects and among them are:

<div style="clear: both"></div>

-   [Tmux Gruvbox theme][github-egel-tmux-gruvbox],
-   [Personal dotfiles configurator][github-egel-dotfiles],
-   [UEK LaTeX Thesis Class][github-egel-uek-latex-thesis-class],
-   [Translations Manager][github-tr]

Although that's only a fragment of my efforts. If you've got some interesting project propositions or just want to say _Hi_, you can achieve it via *maciejsypien at gmail dot com*. I'm always happy to have a nice talk :)

However, if you prefer a private channel, feel free to send me an encrypted email by using my [public PGP key](http://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x10BC01EDA6827DC8).

You can also find my keys manually in one of the public PGP servers: [PGP Public Key Server](https://pgp.key-server.io/), [OpenPGPkeyserver](http://keys.gnupg.net/) or [MIT PGP Public Key Server](https://pgp.mit.edu/).

My key fingerprint is:

```

```

### The blog
In my blog, you can read some of my articles from the IT world, which usually I try to focus on unique topics, that might be difficult to find a good equivalent on the Web.

This blog is also partly my work diary, so many decisions, and the reason why I made it that way, you will also find here. Well, I'm pleased to invite you to sit comfortably and enjoy the content of my blog. Also do not hesitate to leave a comment.
